Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for our Product Information API. 
This API serves as a reliable source for accessing product data,
 offering insights into various product details.

RESTful Conventions and Principles

Our API strictly follows RESTful conventions and principles to provide a structured and intuitive interaction with product information:

Resource Naming

Resource names are designed as nouns in plural form. For instance, `/products` signifies a collection of products, providing a clear and consistent naming pattern.

HTTP Methods

We employ HTTP methods in a meaningful manner:

- `GET` is used for retrieving product information, making it easy to access and view product details.
- We anticipate implementing `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` methods in the future to facilitate CRUD operations for managing products effectively.

Response Codes

Our API ensures that the appropriate HTTP response codes are returned to indicate request outcomes:

- `200 OK`: Successfully fetching product information, ensuring a positive user experience.
- `404 Not Found`: For cases where a requested product is not available, providing clarity in response.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: In the rare event of unexpected server issues, users receive a clear indication of a problem.

Audit Results

In our meticulous audit of the API, we discovered the following aspects that align with RESTful conventions:

- URL Structure**: Our URLs are thoughtfully structured, reflecting the resources and actions they represent, 
enhancing clarity and user-friendliness.
  
- HTTP Methods**: Each HTTP method is applied appropriately, contributing to an intuitive and logical API design.
